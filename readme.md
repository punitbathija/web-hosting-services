- Although I had made insane amount of `Web-pages` with `HTML` & `CSS` this felt like this was the most lenghty. I almost applied all my learnings into creating this one as the project demanded each and every container was build using `flex-box`.

## Learnings

- Learnt how to break and solve one element at a time and not get over-whelmed by the size of the project.
- Achieved everything using `flex-box`
- Also used `box-shadow` to achieve the shadow effect on the button
